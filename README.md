# Important Info

The project is in the "main" branch.

There are two versions. One retuns the value indicated by the exercise following the expected procedure. The second one, commented, returns the amount of a, b and c in each set, the price of the set and the total for that call to the function. Given the way I mix them I could not find a clean way to separate the number of Bs from artificial Bs, meaning those resulting from mixing As and Cs.

# Empanadas price optimizer

This was a logic project for an FSD course at GeeksHubs Academy. The project consisted in taking 3 parameters representing the amount of empanadas and calculate the minimum price to pay for them considering that there is a 3x1 promotion and that the empanadas themselves can be mixed together in halves to average the value of the empanadas used in the mix.
