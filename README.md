# Empanadas price optimizer

This was a logic project for an FSD course at GeeksHubs Academy. The project consisted in taking 3 parameters representing the amount of empanadas and calculate the minimum price to pay for them considering that there is a 3x1 promotion and that the empanadas themselves can be mixed together in halves to average the value of the empanadas used in the mix.
